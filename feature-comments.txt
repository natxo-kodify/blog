Feature: Comments
  As a Blog manager
  I want to allow comments from authors
  In order that they interact a little bit

  Background:
    Given the following authors exist:
      | name             |
      | someone          |
      | over             |
      | rainbow          |
    And the following posts exist:
      | title     | content      | author  |
      | way       | up high      | someone |
      | land      | I heard of   | over    |
      | once      | In a lullaby | rainbow |
    And the following comments exist:
      | text              | post title | author  |
      | nice!!            | way        | someone |
      | Is that a song?   | land       | rainbow |

  Scenario: No comments on a post page
    Given I visit the page for the post with title "once"
    Then I should see a message saying there are no comments

  Scenario: See comments on a post page
    Given I visit the page for the post with title "way"
    Then I should see a comments section with 1 comment
    And The comment I see says "nice!!"
    And I don't see the comment "Is that a song?"

  Scenario: Create a comment
    Given I visit the page for the post with title "once"
    When I click on the button "create comment"
    And I fill the form with "{'text':'Judy Garland was great!', 'author':'someone'}"
    And I click on the button "publish"
    Then a comment should be created for the post with the provided data
    Then I should see a comments section with 1 comment
    And The comment I see says "Judy Garland was great!"
