1. IMO, the list of posts should be a <ol>, and each post a <li>, since it's an ordered list of posts. But I worked as elegantly as possible around the current markup since this is what I'd normally do on an existing codebase.

2. Didn't include Behat code for feature-two-columns as it was just a HTML&CSS job.
